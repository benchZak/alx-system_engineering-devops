Simple Web Stack (1-Server Infrastructure)
Flow
User → DNS (www.foobar.com → 8.8.8.8) → Nginx → App Server → MySQL

Components
Server: Single machine (IP 8.8.8.8).

Web Server (Nginx):

Handles HTTP/HTTPS.

Serves static files.

Proxies dynamic requests to App Server.

Application Server:

Runs backend code (e.g., PHP/Python).

Database (MySQL):

Stores data.

Domain (foobar.com):

www record (CNAME/A) → 8.8.8.8.

Key Explanations
Server: Responds to requests (hardware/software).

Domain: Maps www.foobar.com to 8.8.8.8.

www Record: CNAME (alias) or A (IP).

Web Server: Serves static content, proxies dynamic requests.

App Server: Executes application logic.

Database: Manages data storage.

Communication: HTTP/HTTPS (TCP/IP).

Issues
SPOF: One server = total failure if crashes.

Downtime: Maintenance requires service interruption.

Scaling: Cannot handle high traffic.
