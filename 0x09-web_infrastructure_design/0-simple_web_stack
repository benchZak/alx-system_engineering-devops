Simple Web Stack Design

Diagram Explanation

For this simple web stack, I've designed a basic LAMP (Linux, Apache/Nginx, MySQL, PHP/Python) infrastructure with a single server:

'''

[User Computer] 
    |
    | (HTTP/HTTPS requests via www.foobar.com)
    |
[DNS Server] (Resolves www.foobar.com to 8.8.8.8)
    |
    |
[Single Server @ 8.8.8.8]
    ├── [Nginx Web Server]
    ├── [Application Server]
    ├── [Application Files]
    └── [MySQL Database]

'''

Component Explanations

Server: A physical or virtual machine that provides services to other devices (clients) over a network. In this case, it hosts all our web infrastructure components.

Domain Name (foobar.com):

Human-readable address that maps to an IP address (8.8.8.8) via DNS

The www record is a CNAME record that points to foobar.com (which has an A record pointing to 8.8.8.8)

Web Server (Nginx):

Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests

Serves static content

Acts as reverse proxy passing dynamic requests to application server

Application Server:

Executes the business logic of the application

Processes dynamic content

Communicates with the database as needed

Database (MySQL):

Stores and manages all persistent data

Handles data queries from the application server

Communication Protocol:

The server communicates with user computers primarily via HTTP/HTTPS over TCP/IP

Infrastructure Issues
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

The entire system goes down if the single server fails

No redundancy at any level (web server, app server, or database)

Downtime During Maintenance:

Any maintenance requires taking the entire system offline

Deploying new code means restarting services, causing temporary unavailability

Scaling Limitations:

A single server has finite resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth)

Cannot handle traffic spikes effectively

No load distribution mechanism
