Scaled Up Web Infrastructure Design
Diagram Explanation
This scaled-up infrastructure separates components and adds redundancy:

'''

[User Computer]
    |
    | (HTTPS requests via www.foobar.com)
    |
[Firewall] 
    |
[HAProxy Cluster] (Active/Passive with keepalived/vrrp)
    /               \
[Web Server 1]    [Web Server 2] (Nginx only)
    |                  |
[App Server 1]    [App Server 2] (Application only)
    \                  /
[Primary DB] ---- [Replica DB] (Dedicated MySQL servers)
    |
[Replica DB 2] (Additional read replica)
[Monitoring] [Backup] [Cache Server]

'''

Added Components and Their Purpose
Additional Server:

Dedicated servers for each layer (web, app, database)

Better resource isolation and performance

Allows independent scaling of each component

HAProxy Cluster:

Two load balancers in active-passive configuration

Uses VRRP/keepalived for failover

Eliminates load balancer as SPOF

Component Separation:

Web servers only handle HTTP/HTTPS traffic

App servers only process application logic

Database servers only handle data storage

Each can scale independently as needed

Infrastructure Benefits
Improved Performance:

No resource contention between components

Each layer optimized for its specific workload

Better Reliability:

Load balancer cluster eliminates LB SPOF

Dedicated database servers improve data reliability

Failure in one component doesn't affect others

Enhanced Scalability:

Can scale web tier independently of app tier

Multiple database read replicas for read scaling

Option to add more replicas or shards as needed

Operational Flexibility:

Can update/restart components independently

Easier to troubleshoot performance issues

More granular security controls

Remaining Challenges
Database Write Scaling:

Still only one primary database for writes

Consider sharding or other write-scale solutions

Global Distribution:

All servers in single location

Could add geographic distribution

Advanced Caching:

Could add Redis/Memcached cluster

Reduce database load for common queries

Backup Strategy:

Need comprehensive backup solution

Point-in-time recovery capability
